I would like to give thanks to Andrei Sabelfeld for acting as my examiner for this thesis and providing valuable input. I would also like to thank Anton Ekblad for his supervision and sharing his knowledge when giving advice and valuable feedback on the draft of the report; Daniel Hedin for helping out with questions about JSFlow. I would also like to thank my opponents Anders Nordin, Hannes Sandahl and Daniel Eddeland for their feedback during my presentation. Finally, a big thank goes to my all computer scientists in our lunch room Monaden for great laughs and good discussions about everything and nothing. \\[1cm]
