\section{Background}
As mentioned in Chapter \ref{chapter:intro}, JavaScript has several shortcommings. Two of the tools that will be used in this project is Haste\cite{haste-lang,haste-symposium} and JSFlow\cite{jsflow,jsflow-csf12,jsflow-sac14}.
\subsection{Haste}
Haste (HaSkell To Ecmascript compiler) is a compiler that compiles the high-level language Haskell to JavaScript.
