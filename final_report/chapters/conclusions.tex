\chapter{Conclusions}
This thesis attempted to explore how to effectively combine already created tools for securing JavaScript with focus on information flow control. While some success has been made with the implementation of a library and code generation towards JSFlow for all low flows, as explained in Chapter~\ref{chapter:future}, there are still work and improvements to be done.
