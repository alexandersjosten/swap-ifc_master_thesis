\chapter{Goal and limitations}
This chapter will describe the goals and limitations of the thesis.

\section{Goal}
The goal of the thesis is to create a library that will help close the gap between static and dynamic checks for information flow control. In particular, this will be done by extending Haste to produce JavaScript code targeting JSFlow.

\section{Limitations}
The following areas will not be considered in this thesis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item DOM support.
  \item Support for Haste.App, which will include HTML5 with Websockets.
  \item Dynamic information flow control.
  \item Side-channel attacks towards a system (e.g. timing attack).
  \item Securing any communication outside of the JavaScript that is to be generated by Haste.
\end{itemize}
