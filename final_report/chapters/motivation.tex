\section{Motivation}
As has been explained in Chapter~\ref{chapter:related}, there are already working libraries for information flow control so why would another library be needed? Even though the current libraries are good, they lack one part - integration with another system. The library created for this thesis is supposed to close the gap between a static control for information flow control and already created tools for dynamic check of information flow control (JSFlow) and created tools for securing Javascript from the viewpoint of a type system. The created library will be able to be run in GHC if one wants to create a system strictly for Haskell but it should also be able to run the code with Haste and as a result get produced Javascript code which is tagged so JSFlow can dynamically track the information flow.
